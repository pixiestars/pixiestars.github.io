    <div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><h1>bye (fn)</h1><div><p>so, is this actually unexpected?<br/>are you genuinely surprised by this, or just acting so, considering everyone is fake.<br/>nobody actually cares about me, they're just pretending to do so in order to feel better about themselves<br/></p>
    <p>i'm not worthy to be loved/liked - i am actually genuinely disgusted by the amount of people that &quot;like&quot; talking to me like<br/>stop lying. there are better people out there. much, much better people. i'm the embodiment of irrelevancy.<br/>i have no talent. i can't code, i can't write (some people say i can, but think about what i've just said), i can't make music although i really want<br/>to - i can't do anything - i would love to learn, but i'm too dumb.<br/></p>
    <p>i'm a waste of resources. i'm a waste of time. i'm a waste of capacities.<br/>i pity every single human being on this planet that has to deal with me on even a semi-regular basis. <br/>i'm so boring, i'm literally the least interesting person on this spinning rock.<br/></p>
    <p>there are no positive attributes about my personality nor my appearance. its actually a question leading scientists are begging to find an<br/>appropriate answer to - what's more rancid? &quot;her&quot; personality or &quot;her&quot; appearance - i look like straight out of a dumpster. a person who<br/>knows all excel commands by heart. a person who will never be anything. i don't matter.<br/></p>
    <p>so, what's the point of this? whining? kinda. i'm already awaiting the reactions claiming how much people care about me. well then reply to my<br/>messages and don't fucking ignore me. get out of utopia. if you care about me, talk to me and not only care about me when i'm on the verge<br/>of ending it all, i swear to god. imagine giving me hope in life but then not care about me, applause applause, bravo, dankesch&#246;n!<br/></p>
    <p>anyway i may or may not be preparing something rn. not really death or suicide, but something that'll certainly give me a break of being a<br/>human for a few days if not weeks. trust me, i'm a professional.<br/></p>
    <p>take care and don't forget to drink some water in this heat<br/>yours truly<br/>alice<br/></p>
